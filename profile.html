		<p> After graduating in 2020, I started working as a dental assistent to furhter my dedication towards getting accepted to dental school. Not long after that I began reconsidering my goals for the next 4 years of my life, lets talk about them: </p>

<h2>Goals:</h2> 
<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li>Learn a new skill that once seemed untouchable</li>

<li>Expose myself to the growing tech industry whether it be through project management or programming</li>

<li>Make an income from my newly learned skill(s)</li>

</ul>

<li>Coming from years of healthcare experince, my patience has been tested and strengthened. Working with others with different ideas is what I look forward to.</li>

<li>I'm able to identify, admit, and tend to my flaws that may be hindering any progress in a certain task.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Interests:</h2> 
<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li>Post-grad life gave me just enough time to get hooked on to pilates</li>

<li>My passion and excitment for sneakers has stuck with me throughout the last 6 years</li>

<li>Fun fact: sneaker bots are what first sparked my interest in coding!</li>
